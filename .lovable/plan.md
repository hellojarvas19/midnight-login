## 🖤 Dark Glassmorphism Login / Register Page

A stunning, visually immersive authentication UI for a SaaS Dashboard — built entirely as a frontend experience with no backend required yet.

---

### 🎨 Visual Design System
- **Theme**: Deep black background (`#000` → `#0a0a0f`) with subtle dark purple/blue gradient overlay
- **Glass Cards**: Frosted glass panels using `backdrop-filter: blur`, semi-transparent white borders, and inner glow
- **Accent Colors**: Soft electric blue and violet glows (`#6366f1`, `#8b5cf6`) for highlights, buttons, and active states
- **Typography**: Clean modern sans-serif, white/off-white text hierarchy

---

### 🌀 3D & Animation Effects
- **Floating 3D orbs** in the background — large blurred glowing spheres that slowly drift and pulse
- **Tilt/parallax card effect** — the glass login card subtly rotates in 3D as the user moves their mouse
- **Smooth page entrance** — the card fades + scales in with a spring-like animation on load
- **Input focus glow** — inputs emit a soft neon glow when focused
- **Button ripple + shimmer** — buttons have a light sweep animation on hover
- **Particle/star field** background — subtle animated floating dots/particles behind everything

---

### 📋 Login Page
- **Email** and **Password** input fields with animated floating labels
- **"Sign In"** button with hover shimmer effect
- **"Login with Telegram"** button — styled with Telegram's brand colors, opens Telegram OAuth widget
- Toggle to switch to Register view
- "Forgot password?" link

---

### 📋 Register Page
- **Full Name**, **Email**, **Password**, **Confirm Password** fields
- **"Create Account"** button
- **"Register with Telegram"** button
- Toggle back to Login view
- Password strength indicator bar with animated fill

---

### 🔄 Login ↔ Register Toggle
- Smooth animated transition between the two forms — the card content flips/fades when toggling between Login and Register modes, no page reload

---

### 📱 Responsive
- Fully responsive — centered card layout on desktop, full-screen card on mobile with all effects preserved
